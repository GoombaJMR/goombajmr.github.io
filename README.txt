The website is pretty much complete at this point!

The only changes I might make in the future are things like...
  Course information
  Visuals & Animations w/ JavaScript
  Maybe a blog page
  GPA updates and other information updates (particularly projects)
  
Please enjoy the website, and if you have any questions or constructive criticism, please feel free to message me!
